# Good Leaf Bad Leaf Classification Using YOLOv8
# This project is about classifying good leaves from bad leaves using YOLOv8, a real-time object detection algorithm.

Dependencies
Python 3.8+
PyTorch 1.8+
YOLOv8
OpenCV
Installation
Install Python 3.8+.
Install PyTorch 1.8+.
Install YOLOv8.
Install OpenCV.
Usage
Clone the repository.
Create a new virtual environment and activate it.
Install the dependencies.
Run the following command to train the model:
python train.py


5. Run the following command to detect good and bad leaves in an image:

python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg


## Results

The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 95% on the test set.

## Todo

* Improve the accuracy of the model.
* Add more classes of leaves.
* Make the model more robust to variations in lighting and background.
